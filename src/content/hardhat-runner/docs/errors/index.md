Check the error message for details, or go to the [documentation](https://hardhat.org/config/) to learn more.
### [HH9: Failed to load config file](#HH9)
There was an error while loading your config file. 

The most common source of errors is trying to import the Hardhat Runtime Environment from your config or a file imported from it.
This is not possible, as Hardhat can't be initialized while its config is being defined.

You may also have accidentally imported `hardhat` instead of `hardhat/config`.

Please make sure your config file is correct.
